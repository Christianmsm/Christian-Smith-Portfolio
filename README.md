# Christian Smith Portfolio

## Description

For this project I was tasked with creating my porfolio site for all information about me, work experience, and ways to connect with potential employers & fellow developers. This project was definitely challenging to build everything on my own. However, I was able to do it and learned a lot of interesting things through trial and error along the way in regards too Flexbox, pseudo-class, stylization, and anchor tags.

What I did to complete this assignment was first created my reset styling sheet to give myself full control over all of the styling for the site.

I then went over to the HTML file and started adding all of the information for the site, then I went over to the CSS stylesheet and spent most of my time working on the assignment in there. 

I first started putting things in bigger class grouping but found that I wasn't getting the results as I was wanting so I then started to break the larger groupings I had into individual classes & elements.

I used Flexbox very often for my elements to get placement right and have them arrange how I wanted.

Part of the acceptance criteria was talking about the links, I wanted them to visually change when hovering over so the user knows when they are about to click a link anf for them too go to the section on the site that the link refers too, or open a new tab following the URL it was assigned.

I learned a lot throughout this project and overcame many obsticales.


## Usage

The top nav bar has 4 links: contact me, work, & about me all direct you to parts of the site. The 'Resume' link takes you to the .PDF of my resume.

The 'Work' section has links to sites I have deployed as well as placeholders for when I get my work experience that currently just take you to Google.com.

The 'Contact' section has icons that links you too the corresponding platform, and the final icon is to download my resume.


Attached are links to my GitHub Repo, published site, & a screenshot of the deployed site.
